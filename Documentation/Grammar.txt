SYNOPSIS
                    use <LoadEXAM::Grammar>;
                    This module is used to read the exam files and convert it to a hash datastructure

DESCRIPTION
    This module is used to read the exam files and convert it to a hash
    datastructure. This is done by using a set of regular expressions
    describing the individual section that a string pattern represents.
    Example:

    1. How old are you? - Represents a question [] under 18 [] over 18 -
    Both represent a possible answer

    With this example the module would create hash with following structure:

    { [ { QA => { "Question" => "How old are you?", "Number" => 1, "Answers"
    => [ "under 18", "over 18" ] } } ] }
